ðŸ”« Garmata (Cyrillic: Ð³Ð°Ñ€Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚Ð°, [ËˆÉ¡É‘rmÉ‘tÉ‘], weapon in Belarusian) is a self contained and minimalistic performance testing tool to put a system under load.

> This project is work-in-progress and may introduce big and breaking changes between versions. Minor and Patch changes may rename or restructure parts of this tool. Please consult the help page with the `--help` flag for your executable or the doc pages for the usage of the current version.

# How to install

Either get a prebuild version from the assets in the [Releases page](https://github.com/litvinav/garmata/releases) or build a executable from source files.

# Usage

Run garmata with the `--help` flag to see the usage instructions.
Currently garmata can output the stats summary or the full times as csv to stdout.
```sh
# Perform the test configured in "./configuration.yaml" and print the stats as a summary to stdout
garmata
```
```sh
# Collect performance data for test configured in "./test.yaml" and output as csv into results.csv
garmata -o csv ./test.yaml 1> results.csv
```

Example configuration file:
```yaml
scheme: https # http or https only atm; default is https if not provided
target: httpbin.org # scoped host target; port can be auto resolved based on the request scheme
http_version: "1.1" # default is 1.1 if not provided
groups:
- name: API Backend # optional name for stats group
  users: 2 # default is 1 if not provided
  duration: 10 # duration in seconds
  flow:
  - name: Profile edit route # optional name for stats group
    path: /anything
    method: POST
    body: '{ "hello": "world" }'
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
      Proxy-Authentication: Bearer rIObAeA6W4ysAUDzTJAz9DzvLBGGO60T

```
All groups run in parallel times the amount of users. Each group executes the flow steps sequentially and repeats them until the duration deadline.
